# Rebar Webview

This is the webview component of the Rebar framework. It uses Astro with React to render UI components for plugins.

## Blank Slate Approach

This implementation follows the original Rebar's "blank slate" approach, providing minimal default UI components. This gives plugin developers maximum flexibility to create their own UI designs without having to override or work around pre-existing components.

## Key Components

- `MinimalLayout.tsx`: A minimal layout component that provides only the basic structure needed for the webview.

## Plugin Pages

Plugin pages are automatically generated by the `generatePluginPages.cjs` script. Each plugin that includes a `Page.tsx` component will have a corresponding page generated in the `webview/src/pages/plugins` directory.

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm webview:dev
```

This will start the Astro development server and allow you to preview your webview pages at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building

The webview is built as part of the normal build process:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will compile the TypeScript code, build the webview, and copy the necessary files to the appropriate resource directories.
